# fake-security-IOT
final project for IOT class...pi connected to a led matrix a keypad a pushbutton and a ultrasonic sensor

---

Good portion of it is copy pasted from the 3 links at the bottom of the file and then sorted/shoved into classes for organization purposes.
Most of it is hacky but I learned how to use the GPIO library/spi with python so I liked the experiance.
To actually run a json file with the google authentication keys are needed and a pi has to be wired to the devices.
